Dan Drown reports at (ttps://community.ntppool.org/t/recent-ntp-pool-traffic-increase/18) 
that NTP IPv4 traffic has been increased significantly since December 2013. The 
new volume of NTP traffic increases the load of NTP servers and reduces their 
performance consequently.
Dan Drown further investigations recommend that the origin of traffic should be
mobile devices as the traffics come from many different source IPs. His following
research identify iOS version of Snapchat generate NTP traffic with a high rate.
Dan Drown work motivate us to look at Android application as a point of view of 
their NTP activity. The Lumen (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.berkeley.icsi.haystack&hl=en)
give us a unique opportunity to do the study. It provide information about 
activity behavior of around 3000 android application supports and has 1200 users 
from all around the world. 


Based on Lumen records 72 applications use NTP including highly popular 
application such as whatsapp, subway surfars, shazam, battery doctor and
officesuit + pfd editor. you can find the list of application and their number 
of installation at the end of this post.


As point of view of the application category 10 out of 32 categories use NTP. 
The application from "Tools", "Communication" and "Map & Navigation" categories 
register the most number of NTP request in Lumen database sequentially. 
The NTP query from the first two categories mostly is sent to "2.android.pool.ntp.org" 
pool which NTP community preserves it for Android specifically.

Although there is a specific NTP pool for android applications, only 18% of 
the application communicate with it. However the pool still replies to 
significant volume of NTP query (75,49%) which android applications generate.
This fact recommends that just  limited number of android applications 
with high number of installation choose the right NTP pool.

We continue our research by investigating the geographical distribution of NTP
pool and their android clients. Following list represents domains which recived 
NTP query from android device of Lumen users. We need to make sure that the domains 
are NTP servers to discard irrelevant data. User privacy protection prohibits 
us to evaluate user payload information. Therefore we send NTP quiry to each domains 
instead and check their replies. All the domaines return NTP reply except 
s2m.time.edu.cn. IPAddress.com reports that the domain is under "China education 
and research" authority. 


The result climes that multiple NTP pools receive quires from outside of their
region. For instance asia.pool.ntp.org pool received considerable volume (82.62%)
of query from Europa. "0.us.pool.ntp.org" experiance the same situation. 
 50% volume of its query is originated at Europa.

In the conclusion we should confirm that there is a direct relation between
increasing the number of mobile devices and the number of NTP flows by
considering the Android application category which generate high volume of NTP
query. It tickles security concern. Also the current trend of selecting NTP pool
is not efficient and implies unnecessary delay to the communication.
