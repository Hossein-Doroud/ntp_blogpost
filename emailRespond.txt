Dear all,

Many thanks for your feedbacks.

Although NTP organisation encourage vendors and developers to apply for vendor
zone (vendor pool), I could not find any explanation for difference between
vendor zones and regular NTP pools.I assume servers of vendor zone should be
optimised respectively. I asked in the official NTP mailing list for any
documentation relevant to android.pool.ntp.org as well as load-balancing schema.
Their answer can help us to have a better understanding about NTP load-balancing
schema and about the expected use of each pool. it also can explain why NTP
organisation prefers to create a new zones (pool) for app developer instead
of increasing the number of regional pool servers.

There is not any record in our dataset related to google time server.
Therefore we can not find any evidence about google influence on developer
to select specific NTP server. However it can be interesting to identify
parameters which motivate developers to select a given NTP provider.

Stephan the question that you’ve raised regarding load balancing are very interesting.
Do you think you can measure them using RIP Atlas probes as they’re located
all over the world?
Following I can do measurement on IP addresses which resolve to multiple pools
or do investigation on how ntp.org uses IPv6.

Best regard,
Hossein
