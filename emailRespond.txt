Dear all,

Many thanks for your feedback and suggestions. The question that you’ve 
raised regarding load balancing are very interesting.

NTP org encourages vendors and developers to apply for vendor zones 
(e.g., a vendor pool, e.g., *vendor*.ntp.org as the Android one). 
However, I could not find any explanation regarding the use of 
specific vendor zones and regular NTP pools from a client perspective.

I assume servers of vendor zone should be optimised somehow or expect 
a given workload. I have asked in the official NTP mailing list for 
any documentation relevant to android.pool.ntp.org as well as its 
load-balancing schema.

Hopefully, their answer can help us to have a better understanding 
about NTP's load-balancing schema and about the expected use of each 
pool. It will help us as well to explain why NTP org prefers to create 
a new zones (pool) for app developer instead of increasing the number 
of regional pool servers.

We don't have any record in our dataset about the google time server that
you've mentioned so we cannot tell anything about Google's influence on 
app developers to select specific NTP server. The Android source code 
seems to hardcode the android NTP server (dual stack based on your hint):

https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/40caf8f4432acd2b9d9230b2b1371660521415c2/core/res/res/values/config.xml#802

TODO: TALK ABOUT IP OVERLAP

TODO: TALK ABOUT IPV6 USAGE. NOTE THAT ONE THING IS THE DUAL-STACK SUPPORT ON THE SERVER SIDE AND ANOTHER THING IS DUAL STACK SUPPORT ON THE ISP NETWORK. IF THE ISP DOES NOT SUPPORT IPV6, THEN YOU CANNOT REALLY CONNECT OVER IPV6 SO YOU NEED TO DO THIS ANALYSIS ON A PER-ISP BASES USING THE PUBLIC IP ADDRESS.

It'd be interesting finding the reasoning behind NTP usage by app developers.

Do you think that it'd be possible to measure the load balancing policies
using the RIPE Atlas probes as they’re located all over the world? I'd be
interested in finding out more details about it.

Best regards,
Hossein
